"""Serverless indexing job entry point (``code-search-index``).

The repo set comes from the central ``config.yaml``, read from the workspace at
``--config`` on every run and resolved to canonical ``org/repo`` names by
:func:`indexer.resolve.resolve_repos`. Resolution completes in full -- config
read, enumeration, filtering, dedup, ceiling -- before the first tarball is
fetched, so a bad config exits non-zero having indexed nothing and without ever
opening a database connection.

Orchestrates, per resolved repo: resolve HEAD -> download the tarball by that
immutable SHA -> extract -> parse text files -> extract symbols -> atomic upsert +
mark-and-sweep via :func:`indexer.store.index_repo`. Each repo is isolated; the
process exits non-zero if any repo fails.

Repos are worked on concurrently by a bounded ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` sized by
``config.index_concurrency`` (clamped by
:func:`indexer.repo_config.effective_workers`). A repo whose stored
``(last_indexed_commit, index_semantics_version)`` already equals its current
HEAD SHA and :data:`app.db.models.INDEX_SEMANTICS_VERSION` is skipped before its
tarball is fetched. Because each repo's stamp is written inside that repo's own
transaction, a run killed halfway resumes on the next run with exactly the
remainder -- no checkpoint file, no resume flag. To force a re-index, clear the
provenance: ``UPDATE repos SET index_semantics_version = NULL`` (see
``docs/runbooks/indexing-parallelism.md``, which also names which identity holds
``UPDATE`` on ``repos``).

The engine's pool is DERIVED from that worker count rather than a constant, and
each worker checks local disk headroom before downloading anything -- a
shortfall fails that repo alone rather than the run.

That check is a PRE-FLIGHT SANITY CHECK, not admission control: it reserves
nothing, so N workers can each observe enough free space and then collectively
exhaust the disk. It reliably catches the steady-state case (disk already low
when a repo starts) and converts it into a legible per-repo error; it does NOT
bound the transient case, where an aggregate ENOSPC still surfaces as the opaque
``tarfile`` failure. Sizing ``index_concurrency`` to the disk is the real
control -- see ``docs/runbooks/indexing-parallelism.md``.

When ``cfg.semantic_enabled`` (issue #14), each repo's files are also chunked and
embedded -- but OUTSIDE ``index_repo``'s transaction (A4): the embedder is called
here, up front, and only a ``chunk_writer`` closure over the precomputed vectors
is handed to ``index_repo``, which writes them (pure DML, no network) inside the
same per-file loop as symbols. Flag-off: no chunking, no embedder, no import of
``indexer.embed``'s lazy ``databricks-sdk`` dependency.

Logging is INFO only. The GitHub token is read via an injected client and is never
logged, and this module never lowers root/SDK/httpx log levels (see the redaction
test + source-level tripwire).
