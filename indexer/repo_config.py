"""Repo-config schema, parsing, and ``org/repo`` canonicalisation.

The central ``config.yaml`` declares which repositories the indexing job should
index, as a list of ``connections`` discriminated on ``type``. **The schema is
provider-extensible; the code is GitHub-only** -- ``github`` is the sole v1
variant, ``normalize_repo`` validates against GitHub hosts only, and there is no
``type``-keyed dispatch anywhere. Adding a provider means adding a union member
*and* a fetch implementation; it does not mean parameterising the canonicaliser
or growing a provider abstraction (see the spec's Non-Goals).

This module is deliberately **import-light**: pydantic, PyYAML, and the stdlib
only. No ``httpx`` (``indexer.fetch`` owns all GitHub HTTP), no SQLAlchemy, and
no module-level ``databricks-sdk`` import. Schema tests therefore stay fast and
dependency-free, and ``indexer.resolve`` can import ``normalize_repo`` from here
without the import cycle that living in ``indexer.job`` would create.

Reading the file needs a ``WorkspaceClient``, so the I/O is confined to
:func:`read_workspace_config`, which wraps *every* SDK failure in
:class:`ConfigError` carrying the path and any recoverable HTTP status -- 404
("never synced") must stay distinguishable from 403 ("no read permission").
:func:`parse_config` is pure: bytes in, model out.

class SemanticOverrides(BaseModel):
    """config.yaml's overlay onto the semantic knobs in ``app.config.Settings``.

    The serverless job has **no reachable env surface**: nothing in
    ``resources/job.yml`` sets ``CODE_SEARCH_*``, so every ``Settings`` semantic
    default is effectively hard-coded for the job. This block is how an operator
    moves those knobs from config.yaml -- the one file the job already reads --
    without editing bundle resources and redeploying. Precedence for the job is
    **config.yaml > ``CODE_SEARCH_*`` env > code default**: a field set here wins,
    an unset field (``None``) falls through to whatever the env/``Settings``
    default already resolved to. An absent ``semantic:`` block is a pure no-op, so
    every config predating this schema keeps exactly today's behavior.

    Every field is ``None`` by default -- "not set", NOT "set to false/zero". That
    is load-bearing: ``settings_overrides`` emits a key only for a field the
    operator actually wrote, so ``model_copy(update=...)`` in ``indexer.job``
    touches only those, and an omitted field is never silently forced to a
    default that would clobber the env value it was meant to inherit.

    The env surface (``app.config.get_settings``) is deliberately left as the MCP
    server / webui surface -- those processes have their own environment and this
    block does not reach them. See ``docs/runbooks/semantic-enablement.md``.

    **``max_chunks_per_repo`` here is the GLOBAL ceiling** (one int, the job-wide
    default), distinct from ``RepoConfig.semantic_max_chunks_per_repo`` -- a
    *map* of per-repo overrides. The two are intentionally similarly named because
    they tune the same dimension at different scopes; the per-repo map still beats
    this global from ANY source, because ``indexer.job`` resolves the effective cap
    as ``entry.semantic_max_chunks or cfg.semantic_max_chunks_per_repo`` and this
    block only moves the second operand. Setting both is coherent: raise the floor
    for the whole corpus here, spot-override the outliers in the map.

    Two ``Settings`` semantic knobs are deliberately absent, because exposing them
    would be a lie or a footgun: ``semantic_embedding_dim`` is pinned to
    ``SEMANTIC_EMBEDDING_DIM`` (the ``chunks.embedding`` column type and the 0004
    migration DDL both derive from it, tripwire-tested) -- it is a schema
    invariant, not an operator knob; and ``semantic_chunk_max_tokens`` is not
    consumed by the chunker at all (chunking is bounded by the
    ``SEMANTIC_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS`` constant), so a config key for it would silently
    do nothing.

    Validation mirrors the existing ``index_concurrency`` / per-repo-cap pattern:
    the bound lives on the field (``ge`` / ``gt`` / ``min_length``), so a bad value
    fails at parse time with pydantic's own message and reaches the job as a
    :class:`ConfigError` naming the source path -- never a mid-run surprise.

    ``extra="forbid"`` (unlike the extra-ignore default the rest of this schema
    keeps) is a FAIL-CLOSED guard, not tidiness: this block is the job's only
    semantic kill switch, and pydantic's default would turn a typo'd key
    (``enable: false`` for ``enabled: false``) into a silently ignored no-op that
    leaves semantic indexing ON -- fail-OPEN on exactly the surface that must fail
    loud. An unknown key here raises at parse time instead.

    ``index_concurrency`` is how many repos the indexing job works on at once.

    holds ``MAX_TARBALL_BYTES`` (500 MB) *and* ``MAX_EXTRACTED_BYTES`` (2 GB)
    alive simultaneously -- the downloaded tarball stays inside the worker's
    ``TemporaryDirectory`` while the extraction runs beside it, so peak usage is
    2.5 GB per worker: 10 GB at the default 4, 20 GB at the ceiling of 8.

    **Returns at the ceiling are sublinear.** Symbol extraction does not
    parallelise (measured at 0.95x on 4 threads), so Amdahl's law caps the
    speedup well below 8x while the disk cost stays a hard linear 20 GB. Raise
    it only knowing that trade.

    When semantic indexing is on, the effective worker count is clamped to 2 by
    :func:`effective_workers`. That clamp is a **memory** bound, not a CPU one:
    embedding materialises a whole repo's chunks in memory (~0.5-0.8 GB per
    worker; 260 MB of vectors alone at the 8000-chunk ceiling).

    ``semantic_max_chunks_per_repo`` (the per-repo MAP) overrides that global
    8000-chunk ceiling for individual repos named here, without moving the global
    default. It does NOT relax the 2-worker semantic clamp above -- a large
    override still multiplies the per-worker memory cost of whichever of the (at
    most 2) concurrent semantic workers happens to be indexing that repo.

    The similarly-named ``semantic.max_chunks_per_repo`` (inside the ``semantic:``
    block, a single INT) moves that GLOBAL ceiling itself for the whole job. The
    two coexist by design: this map spot-overrides outliers, ``semantic:`` raises
    the floor everyone inherits. The map still wins for a repo it names, because
