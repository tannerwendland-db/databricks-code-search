"""Repo-config schema, parsing, and ``org/repo`` canonicalisation.

The central ``config.yaml`` declares which repositories the indexing job should
index, as a list of ``connections`` discriminated on ``type``. **The schema is
provider-extensible; the code is GitHub-only** -- ``github`` is the sole v1
variant, ``normalize_repo`` validates against GitHub hosts only, and there is no
``type``-keyed dispatch anywhere. Adding a provider means adding a union member
*and* a fetch implementation; it does not mean parameterising the canonicaliser
or growing a provider abstraction (see the spec's Non-Goals).

This module is deliberately **import-light**: pydantic, PyYAML, and the stdlib
only. No ``httpx`` (``indexer.fetch`` owns all GitHub HTTP), no SQLAlchemy, and
no module-level ``databricks-sdk`` import. Schema tests therefore stay fast and
dependency-free, and ``indexer.resolve`` can import ``normalize_repo`` from here
without the import cycle that living in ``indexer.job`` would create.

Reading the file needs a ``WorkspaceClient``, so the I/O is confined to
:func:`read_workspace_config`, which wraps *every* SDK failure in
:class:`ConfigError` carrying the path and any recoverable HTTP status -- 404
("never synced") must stay distinguishable from 403 ("no read permission").
:func:`parse_config` is pure: bytes in, model out.
