"""Resolve a :class:`~indexer.repo_config.RepoConfig` into :class:`RepoEntry` values.

Enumerate every ``orgs``/``users`` selector, filter the *enumerated* set through
that connection's ``ExcludeRules``, add explicit ``repos`` entries **unfiltered**
(explicit always wins), dedup across connections in first-seen order (unioning
each connection's ``branches:`` globs onto the surviving entry), and fail-fast
on an empty or oversized result -- all before the job downloads a single
tarball.

``normalize_repo`` is imported from :mod:`indexer.repo_config`, never from
:mod:`indexer.job`: ``indexer.job`` imports :func:`resolve_repos` from here, so
the reverse edge would be an import cycle that kills the wheel entry point at
import time with no diagnostic.

The two ``Enumerator`` parameters are a **test seam only** -- plain callables
default-bound to the concrete GitHub functions. There is no registry and no
``type``-keyed dispatch; the schema is provider-extensible, the code is not.
