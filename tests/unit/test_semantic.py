"""Unit tests for app.search.semantic: flag-off no-op, RRF SQL shape, vector literal.

No DB, no SDK. The flag-off contract is proven two ways: the payload builder returns the
feature-absent envelope BEFORE touching a (poisoned) engine, and ``databricks.sdk`` is absent
from ``sys.modules`` after the call (a constructed-but-unused embedder would still import the
SDK, so the short-circuit must return before the embedder is even built). The RRF builder is
pinned to the fusion wrapper + the lakebase leg operators, and ``format_vector_literal``
is proven to use ``repr`` (never the invalid ``format(x, "r")`` code) on scientific notation.
