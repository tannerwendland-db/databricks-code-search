"""Unit tests for indexer.symbols.extract_symbols across the V1 languages.

Covers nested symbols (a method inside a class) and the deliberate kind asymmetry:
Python has no distinct method node (``function_definition`` -> ``function`` even
inside a class) while JS/TS use ``method_definition`` -> ``method``.

    """Each thread gets its own parser; within a thread the parser is reused.

    ``p1 is not p2`` is the load-bearing assertion: it guards the third-party
    contract that ``get_parser`` returns a *fresh* instance per call rather than
    a shared singleton, which is what makes the thread-local cache meaningful.

    Uses explicit threads, not a pool: a pool may serve both calls from one
    worker thread, in which case the thread-local correctly returns the same
    parser and the assertion would fail for the wrong reason.

    The threads run SEQUENTIALLY (start/join, start/join) and deliberately do
    NOT rendezvous on a barrier. A barrier here would make the test a race: it
    releases both threads into ``_parser_for`` at once, so a regression to a
    shared module-level dict could have both observe an empty cache and build
    distinct parsers -- passing while the regression is present. Measured at
    30/30 catches in practice, but "usually" is not what a regression guard is
    for. Sequential execution makes the discrimination total: under a shared
    dict thread 2 gets thread 1's cached parser (``p1 is p2`` -> fail); under
    threading.local it builds its own (-> pass).
