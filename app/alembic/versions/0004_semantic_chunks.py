"""semantic chunks (core chain; default-on semantic search)

Revision ID: 0004
Revises: 0003
Create Date: 2026-07-21 12:00:00.000000

Semantic search is enabled by default, so the ``chunks`` surface ships with the
core migration chain: ``make migrate`` (and therefore ``make deploy``) creates it
with no separate operator ceremony. This supersedes the formerly GATED revision
``0002sem`` (``app/alembic/versions_semantic/``, applied via the now-removed
``make migrate-semantic`` into a separate ``alembic_version_semantic`` table).

**Project-level assumption (was a gate, now an assumption):** the target Lakebase
project's Databricks-managed ``shared_preload_libraries`` already includes
``lakebase_vector,lakebase_text``. That preload change is irreversible,
project-level, and performed out-of-band (UI/support) -- this migration cannot
perform it. When the preload is absent, ``CREATE EXTENSION`` fails loudly with
"must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries" -- now at ``make migrate``/deploy
time -- and that error IS the signal to go complete the preload prerequisite.
See ``docs/runbooks/semantic-enablement.md``.

**Idempotency guard:** a project that already ran the old gated migration has
``chunks`` (and possibly ``alembic_version_semantic``). ``to_regclass('chunks')``
short-circuits the CREATE DDL for that case -- this revision then only adds the
``start_line``/``end_line`` columns the gated revision predates, records itself in the
core ``alembic_version``, and drops the orphaned semantic version table.

Line ranges: ``start_line``/``end_line`` (1-based, inclusive) are NULLABLE -- rows
written before the line-aware chunk writer stay NULL until the next re-index naturally
backfills them (the INDEX_SEMANTICS_VERSION bump forces exactly that), and readers must
treat NULL as "no authoritative range" (the webui falls back to its needle-match anchor).

Ground truth (captured 2026-07-19 against the live ``code-search`` Lakebase project,
Postgres 17, on a disposable branch): the ANN access method is ``lakebase_ann`` with
the non-default ``vector_cosine_ops`` opclass (and it REJECTS any
``WITH (m=..., ef_construction=...)`` params); the BM25 access method is
``lakebase_bm25`` over the generated ``ts`` ``tsvector`` column. ``lakebase_text``
builds on ``lakebase_tokenizer``, so the extensions are created tokenizer -> vector
-> text before the dependent indexes (mirroring 0001's extension-before-index order).
