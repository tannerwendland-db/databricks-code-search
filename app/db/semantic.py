"""Standalone Core schema for the semantic-search surface.

``chunks`` lives in its OWN ``MetaData()`` instance -- it is deliberately NOT added to
``app.db.models.Base.metadata``. The DDL is hand-written: ``chunks.embedding`` is a
``vector`` column and ``chunks.ts`` a ``GENERATED`` ``tsvector`` column backed by the
``lakebase_vector`` / ``lakebase_text`` extensions, none of which SQLAlchemy Core can
declare portably. If ``chunks`` lived in ``Base.metadata``, a routine ``make migration``
would try to diff it against what the hand-written ``0004`` revision actually created,
producing spurious drift -- the ``include_object`` filter in ``app/alembic/env.py`` is
the second half of that protection (any database autogenerate runs against now contains
``chunks``, and without the filter autogenerate would emit ``drop_table('chunks')``).

This module declares the Core ``Table`` only -- it is a typed description of the
production shape (and the read/write path's expectations), not a migration. The ``0004``
core revision (``app/alembic/versions/0004_semantic_chunks.py``) is the sole owner of
the real DDL.
