"""Grep search: precise per-line match extraction over compiler candidates (issue #10).

The impure phase-3 orchestration layer. It composes the pure seams --
:func:`app.query.parser.parse` / :func:`app.query.parser.resolve_case` /
:func:`app.query.compiler.compile_query` -- and never re-derives predicate or case logic:
the compiler stays the single source of truth for *which files match*; grep owns *which
lines match within them*.

Design (two-step, streamed):

1. Compile the AST to a trgm-accelerated candidate ``Select`` (id + locator columns, no
   content) and run it to get the ordered candidate ids.
2. Fetch ``content`` for those ids with ``.execution_options(yield_per=1)`` -- a one-row
   server-side cursor -- and rescan each file line-by-line in Python into zoekt-shaped
   :class:`LineMatch` groups. Bare ``stream_results`` keeps a *growing* buffer and does NOT
   bound memory; ``yield_per=1`` is load-bearing.

Bounds (bounded resource use is correctness, not polish):

* **DB time** is bounded by a per-request, transaction-local ``statement_timeout``. A
  cancellation raises :class:`QueryTooBroadError` (a timeout cancels the *candidate* query
  -> zero usable rows, so any returned value would be an empty result indistinguishable
  from "no matches" -- a lie; total failure raises, partial success flags).
* **App memory** is bounded to ~one file at a time (``yield_per=1``) plus a per-request
  aggregate byte cap on content pulled/scanned. A cap that trips sets ``truncated`` with a
  ``truncation_reason``; a capped result never masquerades as complete.

Caveats (load-bearing, documented, never silently wrong):

* **NOT RE2.** Python ``re`` is not Postgres POSIX ARE, and matching here is line-oriented:
  ``^``/``$`` are line anchors, ``.`` never crosses lines, and cross-line constructs (e.g.
  ``(?s)...``) do not span lines. A Postgres-valid regex that Python ``re`` rejects is
  skipped (that atom contributes no highlights) and ``regex_incompatible`` is set. The SQL
  predicate already selected the file; grep only degrades the *highlighting*. Case folding
  can also diverge: ``re.IGNORECASE`` (Python Unicode folding) and Postgres ``lower()`` do
  not agree on every non-ASCII pair (e.g. ``ß``/``SS``, Turkish dotless ``i``), so a file
  the SQL predicate matched case-insensitively may yield zero Python highlights and drop
  out. ASCII is unaffected.
* **Highlight-driven results.** A file appears only if at least one line produces a
  non-empty highlight span, so two query shapes the SQL predicate *does* match still return
  no files. Both are now **announced by name** rather than returning a silent empty result
  indistinguishable from a true negative (issue #31):

  1. A filter-only query with no content atom (e.g. ``lang:go`` alone -- there is nothing to
     highlight; file listing is a separate concern) sets ``no_content_atom``.
  2. A query whose atoms all match zero-width (e.g. ``/^/``, ``/\b/`` -- dropped as
     non-highlights, and NOT ``regex_incompatible`` since the pattern compiled fine) sets
     ``zero_width_only_atoms``.

  Both flags are guarded by ``regex_incompatible`` (see :func:`_no_content_atom` /
  :func:`_zero_width_only_atoms`): an atom that never compiled is a content atom whose
  highlighting capability is *unknown*, and ``regex_incompatible`` is already its signal.
  Neither flag covers the **case-folding divergence** described in the NOT-RE2 bullet above:
  a file the SQL predicate matched case-insensitively that yields zero Python highlights
  drops out with patterns present, non-empty, and of non-zero width -- so it is
  **still entirely unsignalled**. Fixing that needs a new provable signal (follow-up), not
  one of these two.
* **Uncapped Python CPU (V1 limitation).** The byte cap bounds memory and aggregate bytes
  scanned but NOT CPU/wall-clock: a catastrophic-backtracking ``re`` pattern on a single
  *under-cap* file runs unbounded, holds the GIL, and can starve the app.
  ``statement_timeout`` does not cover Python work. No guard ships in V1; the real fix is an
  RE2 binding (follow-up).
* **Per-file memory** relies on the indexer's per-file byte cap (issue #7 ``MAX_FILE_BYTES``)
  keeping any single ``content`` bounded; ``File.size`` is nullable/unpopulated in this
  branch, so a ``size`` pre-filter is intentionally NOT used.

Byte offsets are UTF-8, line-local, half-open ``[start, end)``: for a :class:`LineMatch`,
``line_text.encode("utf-8")[start:end]`` is exactly the matched bytes (file-absolute offsets
are a documented follow-up).

    check in :func:`extract_line_matches` always drops it. ``^``, ``$``, ``\\b`` and lookarounds
    all report ``(0, 0)``.

    Sound (given the guards) but **incomplete**: ``a*`` reports a huge ``max_width`` and is
    correctly not flagged -- it genuinely *can* highlight, so a flag would be wrong.
    (``re.compile('a*').finditer('bar')`` yields the non-empty span ``(1, 2)``; see
    ``test_zero_width_regex_matches_are_dropped``.) The residual gap is corpus-dependent and NOT
    statically decidable: ``a*`` over a corpus containing no ``a`` returns zero files unflagged.
    The error direction is false-negatives -- silence -- only, which is what makes the
    private-API dependency below acceptable.

    ``regex_incompatible`` is a REQUIRED conjunct, mirroring :func:`_no_content_atom`. For
    ``/^/ /[/`` the ``[`` atom never compiled, so it is absent from ``patterns`` and its
    highlighting capability is **unknown, not proven zero-width**. Without the conjunct this
    would claim a proof it does not have.

    Empty terms are **reachable and correctly flagged**: ``parse('""')`` yields
    ``Substring(value='')`` and ``parse('//')`` yields ``Regex(pattern='')``, both compiling to

    ``True`` is the right answer for them; no guard is needed.
