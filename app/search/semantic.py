"""Hybrid semantic + BM25 search over ``chunks`` via reciprocal-rank fusion (issue #14).

The serve-side companion to :mod:`app.search.grep` / :mod:`app.search.symbols` for
natural-language queries. Where grep answers *which lines match a zoekt pattern*, this
module answers *which chunks are most relevant to a free-text query*, fusing a vector-ANN
leg (cosine distance over ``chunks.embedding``) and a BM25 leg (over the generated
``chunks.ts`` ``tsvector``) with reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF, ``k=60``).

Two load-bearing shapes, both grounded against the live Lakebase project (plan REV 3):

1. **One shared RRF fusion wrapper, two rank-CTE legs.** The fusion arithmetic (two
   rank CTEs, ``FULL OUTER JOIN``, ``1/(k+rank)`` sum) wraps a per-leg distance/score
   fragment (:data:`_ANN_METRIC` / :data:`_BM_METRIC`). Each leg's ``ORDER BY <metric>
   LIMIT :topk`` runs in an INNER subquery so the ANN / BM25 index is usable (an
   index-defeating outer ``row_number()`` sort is the thing to avoid); ``row_number()``
   then ranks only those ``:topk`` rows. The legs use the real ``lakebase_ann`` ``<=>``
   and ``lakebase_bm25`` ``<@>`` / ``to_bm25query`` operators -- this project is
   Lakebase-only, so there is no other backend. The BM25 fragment is shaped so
   ``ORDER BY metric ASC`` puts the best row first (lakebase BM25 scores are negative;
   more-negative = better).

2. **The query vector is a bound param, never interpolated.** :func:`format_vector_literal`
   builds ``"[f0,f1,...]"`` with ``repr`` (``repr(1e-05) == "1e-05"``; ``format(x, "r")`` is
   an invalid format code and raises), and it is bound as ``:qvec`` cast ``(:qvec)::vector``
   -- no ``register_vector`` adapter, no f-string interpolation of floats into SQL.

Result envelope: each result returns ``chunk_index`` + ``content`` (joined ``chunks ->
files -> repos`` for the ``repo`` name and file ``path``) plus the chunk's 1-based
inclusive ``start_line``/``end_line`` (issue #44) -- nullable, NULL for rows indexed
before the line-aware chunk writer.

Flag-off is a true no-op: :func:`_semantic_search_payload` short-circuits on the FIRST line
when ``cfg.semantic_enabled`` is false, returning the feature-absent payload BEFORE touching
the engine or the embedder -- so ``databricks-sdk`` is never imported on the disabled path.

    The ``ORDER BY metric LIMIT :topk`` lives in an INNER subquery so the ANN / BM25 index is
    usable; ``row_number()`` then ranks only those candidates (never a full-table sort).
    ``branch_pred`` (see :func:`_branch_predicate`) is always present -- it lives in the INNER
    subquery's ``WHERE``, never the ``ORDER BY``, so it never costs the index a second sort key.

    Qualification scope is critical (0003): the INNER subquery joins ``chunks c`` to
    ``files f`` / ``repos r`` for branch scoping, so ``metric``/``extra_where`` must be
    ``c.``-qualified (``c.embedding``, ``c.ts``) and the inner projection is ``SELECT c.id AS
    id``. The OUTER ``row_number()`` window (this CTE's own ``SELECT``) stays BARE -- ``id``,
    never ``c.id`` -- because it selects from the derived table ``s``, whose only columns are
    ``id``/``metric``; ``c`` is out of scope there and referencing it raises "missing
    FROM-clause entry for table c".

    Determinism (issues #9/#13) is enforced ONLY where it does not cost the index:

    * ``row_number()`` breaks ties on ``id``. Scores plateau (BM25 especially), and arbitrary
      rank assignment among equals changes each row's ``1/(k+rank)`` contribution, so the same
      query over the same corpus could otherwise fuse to a different order. This is free: the
      window sorts an already-materialized <= topk-row set, no index involved.
    * The INNER ``ORDER BY`` stays a SINGLE expression on BOTH legs. This is load-bearing:
      Postgres cannot build an ordered-index path when a second sort key follows an
      ``ORDER BY``-operator key, and the fallback is not cost-based -- it will seq-scan and
      full-sort the table even with ``enable_seqscan = off``. Both ``lakebase_ann``'s ``<=>``
      and ``lakebase_bm25``'s ``<@>`` are such operators, so adding ``, id`` here would
      silently collapse the leg to a full scan in production. It would also buy nothing:
      an approximate index's candidate-set membership is nondeterministic regardless, so
      there is no tie-stability to win at that level.

    NOTE: the unit test asserts the SQL SHAPE (no inner tiebreak) rather than a plan --
    plan-level regressions on the lakebase operators are only observable against a real
    Lakebase branch.
