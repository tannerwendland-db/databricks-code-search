"""Hybrid semantic + BM25 search over ``chunks`` via reciprocal-rank fusion (issue #14).

The serve-side companion to :mod:`app.search.grep` / :mod:`app.search.symbols` for
natural-language queries. Where grep answers *which lines match a zoekt pattern*, this
module answers *which chunks are most relevant to a free-text query*, fusing a vector-ANN
leg (cosine distance over ``chunks.embedding``) and a BM25 leg (over the generated
``chunks.ts`` ``tsvector``) with reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF, ``k=60``).

Two load-bearing shapes, both grounded against the live Lakebase project (plan REV 3):

1. **One shared RRF fusion wrapper, backend-selected legs.** The fusion arithmetic (two
   rank CTEs, ``FULL OUTER JOIN``, ``1/(k+rank)`` sum) is IDENTICAL for both backends; only
   the per-leg distance/score fragment differs (:data:`_ANN_METRIC` / :data:`_BM_METRIC`).
   Each leg's ``ORDER BY <metric> LIMIT :topk`` runs in an INNER subquery so the ANN / BM25
   index is usable (an index-defeating outer ``row_number()`` sort is the thing to avoid);
   ``row_number()`` then ranks only those ``:topk`` rows. The ``lakebase`` backend uses the
   real ``lakebase_ann`` ``<=>`` and ``lakebase_bm25`` ``<@>`` / ``to_bm25query`` operators;
   the ``standin`` backend (CI ``pgvector/pgvector:pg16``, which lacks the ``lakebase_*``
   extensions) uses pgvector's identical ``<=>`` and substitutes ``ts_rank_cd`` for BM25 --
   an APPROXIMATION that exercises the fusion plumbing and the real ANN operator but NOT the
   production BM25 ranking (that is proven only by the live smoke leg). Both BM25 fragments
   are shaped so ``ORDER BY metric ASC`` puts the best row first (lakebase BM25 scores are
   negative; the standin negates ``ts_rank_cd``), keeping the wrapper byte-identical.

2. **The query vector is a bound param, never interpolated.** :func:`format_vector_literal`
   builds ``"[f0,f1,...]"`` with ``repr`` (``repr(1e-05) == "1e-05"``; ``format(x, "r")`` is
   an invalid format code and raises), and it is bound as ``:qvec`` cast ``(:qvec)::vector``
   -- no ``register_vector`` adapter, no f-string interpolation of floats into SQL.

Result envelope (V1 limitation, documented): ``chunks`` carries no line ranges, so each
result returns ``chunk_index`` + ``content`` (joined ``chunks -> files -> repos`` for the
``repo`` name and file ``path``), not a precise ``start_line``/``end_line``.

Flag-off is a true no-op: :func:`_semantic_search_payload` short-circuits on the FIRST line
when ``cfg.semantic_enabled`` is false, returning the feature-absent payload BEFORE touching
the engine or the embedder -- so ``databricks-sdk`` is never imported on the disabled path.

    The ``ORDER BY metric LIMIT :topk`` lives in an INNER subquery so the ANN / BM25 index is
    usable; ``row_number()`` then ranks only those candidates (never a full-table sort).
    ``branch_pred`` (see :func:`_branch_predicate`) is always present -- it lives in the INNER
    subquery's ``WHERE``, never the ``ORDER BY``, so it never costs the index a second sort key.

    Qualification scope is critical (0003): the INNER subquery joins ``chunks c`` to
    ``files f`` / ``repos r`` for branch scoping, so ``metric``/``extra_where`` must be
    ``c.``-qualified (``c.embedding``, ``c.ts``) and the inner projection is ``SELECT c.id AS
    id``. The OUTER ``row_number()`` window (this CTE's own ``SELECT``) stays BARE -- ``id``,
    never ``c.id`` -- because it selects from the derived table ``s``, whose only columns are
    ``id``/``metric``; ``c`` is out of scope there and referencing it raises "missing
    FROM-clause entry for table c".

    Determinism (issues #9/#13) is enforced ONLY where it does not cost the index:

    * ``row_number()`` breaks ties on ``id``. Scores plateau (BM25 especially), and arbitrary
      rank assignment among equals changes each row's ``1/(k+rank)`` contribution, so the same
      query over the same corpus could otherwise fuse to a different order. This is free: the
      window sorts an already-materialized <= topk-row set, no index involved.
    * The INNER ``ORDER BY`` stays a SINGLE expression on BOTH legs. This is load-bearing:
      Postgres cannot build an ordered-index path when a second sort key follows an
      ``ORDER BY``-operator key, and the fallback is not cost-based -- it will seq-scan and
      full-sort the table even with ``enable_seqscan = off``. Both ``lakebase_ann``'s ``<=>``
      and ``lakebase_bm25``'s ``<@>`` are such operators, so adding ``, id`` here would
      silently collapse the leg to a full scan in production. It would also buy nothing:
      an approximate index's candidate-set membership is nondeterministic regardless, so
      there is no tie-stability to win at that level.

    NOTE: CI cannot catch a regression here on the BM25 leg -- the stand-in metric
    (``ts_rank_cd``) is never index-ordered, so its plan is seq-scan + sort either way. The
    unit test therefore asserts the SQL SHAPE (no inner tiebreak) rather than a plan.
