"""Hybrid semantic + BM25 search over ``chunks`` via reciprocal-rank fusion (issue #14).

The serve-side companion to :mod:`app.search.grep` / :mod:`app.search.symbols` for
natural-language queries. Where grep answers *which lines match a zoekt pattern*, this
module answers *which chunks are most relevant to a free-text query*, fusing a vector-ANN
leg (cosine distance over ``chunks.embedding``) and a BM25 leg (over the generated
``chunks.ts`` ``tsvector``) with reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF, ``k=60``).

Two load-bearing shapes, both grounded against the live Lakebase project (plan REV 3):

1. **One shared RRF fusion wrapper, backend-selected legs.** The fusion arithmetic (two
   rank CTEs, ``FULL OUTER JOIN``, ``1/(k+rank)`` sum) is IDENTICAL for both backends; only
   the per-leg distance/score fragment differs (:data:`_ANN_METRIC` / :data:`_BM_METRIC`).
   Each leg's ``ORDER BY <metric> LIMIT :topk`` runs in an INNER subquery so the ANN / BM25
   index is usable (an index-defeating outer ``row_number()`` sort is the thing to avoid);
   ``row_number()`` then ranks only those ``:topk`` rows. The ``lakebase`` backend uses the
   real ``lakebase_ann`` ``<=>`` and ``lakebase_bm25`` ``<@>`` / ``to_bm25query`` operators;
   the ``standin`` backend (CI ``pgvector/pgvector:pg16``, which lacks the ``lakebase_*``
   extensions) uses pgvector's identical ``<=>`` and substitutes ``ts_rank_cd`` for BM25 --
   an APPROXIMATION that exercises the fusion plumbing and the real ANN operator but NOT the
   production BM25 ranking (that is proven only by the live smoke leg). Both BM25 fragments
   are shaped so ``ORDER BY metric ASC`` puts the best row first (lakebase BM25 scores are
   negative; the standin negates ``ts_rank_cd``), keeping the wrapper byte-identical.

2. **The query vector is a bound param, never interpolated.** :func:`format_vector_literal`
   builds ``"[f0,f1,...]"`` with ``repr`` (``repr(1e-05) == "1e-05"``; ``format(x, "r")`` is
   an invalid format code and raises), and it is bound as ``:qvec`` cast ``(:qvec)::vector``
   -- no ``register_vector`` adapter, no f-string interpolation of floats into SQL.

Result envelope (V1 limitation, documented): ``chunks`` carries no line ranges, so each
result returns ``chunk_index`` + ``content`` (joined ``chunks -> files -> repos`` for the
``repo`` name and file ``path``), not a precise ``start_line``/``end_line``.

Flag-off is a true no-op: :func:`_semantic_search_payload` short-circuits on the FIRST line
when ``cfg.semantic_enabled`` is false, returning the feature-absent payload BEFORE touching
the engine or the embedder -- so ``databricks-sdk`` is never imported on the disabled path.
