"""Payload builders for the search corpus, shared by the MCP app and the web UI app (issue #35).

Extracted from ``app/main.py`` so a second Databricks App (``webui/``) can call the exact same
search/file/repo-listing logic in-process without importing the MCP server module (which builds
a ``FastMCP``/Starlette ASGI app as an import side effect). ``app/main.py`` keeps ``_``-prefixed
aliases (``_search_code_payload = service.search_code_payload`` etc.) for its own call sites and
existing tests, so this move is a pure relocation: wire shapes, signatures, and behavior are
byte-identical to before.

Pure-ish builders (engine + config in, dict out) so unit tests pin the exact wire shape without
the SDK. Each opens its own connection INSIDE the caller's thread (never shares one across
threads). Shapes are pinned to zoekt parity (``tests/unit/test_main.py``).

    Content matches (grep) and ``sym:`` definition matches (:func:`symbol_search`) are folded

    a path may have more than one indexed content version, one per divergent branch group, so
    the merge key includes ``content_sha`` to keep them as distinct file entries -- each
    carrying its own real ``branches`` membership array instead of the old hardcoded
    ``["HEAD"]``), matching zoekt's single-tool model where ``sym:`` results ride the normal
    envelope. A symbol match carries
    ``symbols: [{name, kind}]`` and ``line`` = the definition's first line (no highlight ``text``
    in V1, so ``grep_search("sym:X")`` -- which returns nothing highlight-driven -- is answered
    here). ``QueryParseError`` -> ``query_parse_error`` + empty files; ``QueryTooBroadError``
    (either leg) -> ``query_too_broad`` + ``truncated``. ``repo_id`` is resolved to ``Repo.name``.
    ``byte_ranges`` are our UTF-8 line-local half-open offsets (documented divergence from
    zoekt's char ``start_col``/``end_col``).

    **Query-shape suppression (issue #31).** grep's ``no_content_atom`` /
    ``zero_width_only_atoms`` are per-leg facts; both are ANDed here with ``not sym_answers``
    so neither fires on a query the symbol leg answered. ``sym:Handler`` is filter-only to grep
    but fully answered here, and ``sym:Handler /^/`` is zero-width-only to grep yet returns
    files -- flagging either would contradict the results sitting beside it and train agents to
    ignore the signal.

    ``sym_answers`` treats an UNKNOWN symbol leg (``sym_result is None``, i.e. the leg timed
    out) as answering, which is a proof rather than a precaution: ``None`` arises only from
    ``QueryTooBroadError``, which means the DB was hit, which means the ``if not patterns``
    short-circuit at ``symbols.py:173`` was False, which means the query HAD a ``sym:`` atom.
    The inverted form (``sym_result is not None and ...``) would emit a false flag on exactly
    that timed-out ``sym:`` query. Corollary: suppression can never swallow the filter-only
    case this issue exists to signal -- a query like ``file:.md`` has no ``sym:`` atom, so it
    short-circuits before any DB hit and can never reach ``sym_result is None``.

    **Pagination mode (issue #35 A2).** Omitting ``cursor`` entirely (its sentinel default)
    reproduces every byte of the pre-#35 envelope -- no ``next_cursor`` key, and a row-capped
    grep result still sets ``truncated=True``/``"row_cap"``. Supplying ``cursor`` at all --
    INCLUDING ``None`` for page 1, which the webui API always does -- switches to pagination
    mode: the envelope always carries a ``next_cursor`` (``str | null``), and a grep row-cap
    fill sets ``truncated=False`` + a non-null ``next_cursor`` instead of an error banner (see
    :func:`app.search.grep.grep_search`'s own mode gating, which this mirrors exactly). A
    garbled/tampered/version-mismatched ``cursor`` string raises :class:`CursorError`
    UNCAUGHT -- never silently restarts at page 1.

    The symbol leg (``sym:`` definitions) folds in ONLY on page 1 (pagination mode with
    ``cursor=None``); continuation pages (``cursor`` is a real cursor) skip it entirely, so a
    multi-page ``sym:X foo`` result never repeats a symbol. See :func:`_query_has_symbol_atom`
